All this configuration is public.

* `styles` - Override stylesheets. Add your `local.css` file to override Citizen OS default stylesheets. Good for adding your own branding.
* `imgs` - Custom images. Add your images that you reference from `local.css` here. For example your own logo. You can use the `mylogo_big.example.png` and `mylogo_small.example.png` as templates for the right format.
